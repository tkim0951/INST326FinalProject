What does Our Project do?
Our Project Is a game of blackjack, where you start with 100 dollars and then can bet from there. 
After placing your bet, you can either be hit with a card or stand.
If you have a higher number than the dealer, you win, but if you have a lower number or go over 21, you lose.

How to run the Code?
From the Command Line, you just play the code, and it will ask you how much you want to bet out of 100
